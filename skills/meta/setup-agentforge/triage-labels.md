# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Canonical role      | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`      | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`        | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`   | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for automated work |
| `ready-for-human`   | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`           | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the ready-for-agent triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use. If your tracker uses different names (e.g. `bug:triage` instead of `needs-triage`), update the mapping here — skills will read this file and apply the correct labels.
